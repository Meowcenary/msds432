Legacy REST APIs might suffer from data over-fetching or under-fetching compared to the new technology of GraphQL. Give
an example to illustrate how REST API might be over-fetching data.

After you review the different data exchange formats and the categories of communication styles, provide an example of a
data analytics application to illustrate the usage of one of these communication styles. Discuss whether the data source
in your example is geared toward batch or near real-time interactive processing.

For the final project, we need to connect to the City of Chicago data portal to collect data for batch and interactive
processing. The City of Chicago offers an API to its datasets using Socrata Open Data API (SODA). Explain how we could
use SODA APILinks to an external site. to collect data on COVIDLinks to an external site., taxi tripsLinks to an
external site., poverty in community areas, unemployment, and per capita incomeLinks to an external site..

The strategic planning team for the City of Chicago has asked you to identify the top three community areas with the
highest unemployment and the highest percentage of people below the poverty line so that they can offer incentives for
developers and investors in those community areas. As a data engineer, you have access to two datasets: the building
permits datasetLinks to an external site. and the unemployment/poverty datasetLinks to an external site..
---

---
After you inspect these two datasets, discuss how you will tackle the issue of the absence of zip codes in the
unemployment dataset to track the number of building permits issued for every community area that the City of Chicago
can use to offer incentives to developers and investors in the underserved and underinvested community areas. The City
of Chicago has a link that lists Chicago communitiesLinks to an external site. relative to their zip codes and
neighborhood labels; note that it is not a one-to-one mapping.
